      Seymour uses Claude AI to intelligently filter your RSS feeds based on your preferences.
      You provide custom prompts that act as filtering criteria, and Claude decides which posts to show or hide.
      This creates a personalized, curated timeline that matches your interests.
      <br /><br />

      To curate your feed, simply describe what you'd like to see...or not see.
      For example:
    </p>
    <p class="bg-surface-container p-2">
      <code>"Show me recipes for healthy meals, but not ones that include garlic."</code>
    </p>
    Or maybe you need a break from politics:
    <p class="bg-surface-container p-2">
      <code>"Show me news articles about Ohio, but not ones that mention national politics."</code>
    </p>
    Your feed is in your control! As with any prompt, being incredibly descriptive or providing examples
    will yield more favorable results.
